Quant + Physics + AI Portfolio

Hi, I'm Aiden Raj, a high school student passionate about physics, quantitative finance, and AI.  
This repository is my journey, from high school projects to original research in Cyclic Information-preserving String Theory (CIST), a theory that I am currently developing and quantitative modeling.

What I do:
- Quant Finance: Monte Carlo simulations, trading strategies, ML.
- Physics projects and sims: Classical, E&M, and quantum simulations.
- AI learning for machine learning applied to both markets & physics.
- CIST Research: My independent theory on cyclic cosmology & information.

Tech:
- Python 
- JAVA 
- LaTeX (for research papers)
